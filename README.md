Option 2️⃣: Query Active Peers
This will display a list of all connected peers.

Option 0️⃣: Quit the Program
This will close the peer node and exit the program.

You will have to run the program in different terminals and name your peer in each terminal.The above steps can be followed in each terminal.
The outputs of test case (given in pdf) are given from images output1_P1 to output1_P4; the two outputs after P1 sends exit message to P3 is in output2_P1 and output2_P3.

Option 3️⃣: Connect to Active Peers
Enter the IP address of the peer (e.g., 127.0.0.1).
Enter the port number of the peer (e.g., 4002).
If the connection is successful, the peer will be added to active peers.

Option 0️⃣: Quit the Program
This will close the peer node and exit the program.

You will have to run the program in different terminals and name your peer in each terminal.
The above steps can be followed in each terminal.
 The interface of the output is shown in Bonus_q_interface image.
